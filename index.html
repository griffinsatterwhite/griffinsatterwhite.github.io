                <h3>Metroid Showcase</h3>
            </li>
            <p> I built this project for my EECS 494 game design class. I completed the project over<br> 
                3 weeks learning Unity in the process. I was the main developer for enemy implementation <br> 
                and custom level building. I assisted with all parts of the codebase, so I'm very <br>
                farmiliar with the project.</p>

                <h3>WaveLength (P2)</h3>
            </li>
            <p> During this 2 week prototype design, I focued on creating gameplay revolving around <br>
                vision mechanics. I implemented a dynamic light frequency system that based around <br>
                the movement of the player. </p>

                <h3>Bunker Bros (P3)</h3>
            </li>
            <p> In Bunker Bros, I was responsible for the visual design of the player UI system. <br>
                I also designed and integrated the majority of in-game object models and art <br> 
                used in both the UI systems. </p>
